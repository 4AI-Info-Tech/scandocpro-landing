In an era where mobile devices handle increasingly sensitive information, **document security** is more critical than ever. This guide covers essential practices for keeping your digital documents safe.

## Understanding the Risks

Mobile document scanning introduces several security considerations:

- **Device theft or loss** - physical access to your data
- **Cloud storage vulnerabilities** - third-party data breaches
- **Network interception** - man-in-the-middle attacks
- **App permissions** - unnecessary access to your data

## Best Practices for Document Security

### 1. Use On-Device Processing

Whenever possible, choose apps that process documents locally:

- Your data stays on your device
- No internet connection required
- Reduced attack surface

ScanDocPro processes all documents on-device by default.

### 2. Enable Encryption

Ensure your sensitive documents are encrypted:

- **At rest**: Encrypt stored documents on your device
- **In transit**: Use secure channels for sharing
- **End-to-end**: Verify recipient encryption

### 3. Implement Access Controls

Protect your device and apps:

- Use strong passwords or biometric locks
- Enable automatic screen lock
- Review and limit app permissions
- Use app-specific passwords where available

### 4. Secure Your Cloud Backups

If using cloud storage:

- Choose providers with strong encryption standards
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regularly review access logs
- Understand data residency requirements

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Healthcare (HIPAA Compliance)

- Use HIPAA-compliant storage solutions
- Implement audit trails for document access
- Train staff on privacy procedures

### Legal (Attorney-Client Privilege)

- Ensure end-to-end encryption
- Maintain chain of custody records
- Use secure client portals for sharing

### Finance (PCI DSS, GDPR)

- Tokenize sensitive financial data
- Implement data retention policies
- Regular security assessments

## Creating a Security Policy

2. **Handling procedures** - define who can access what
3. **Incident response** - plan for security breaches
4. **Regular training** - keep staff informed

## Conclusion

Document security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. By following these best practices and choosing secure tools like ScanDocPro, you can protect your sensitive information while enjoying the convenience of mobile document management.

Remember: the most secure document is one that never leaves your device unnecessarily.
