ScanDocPro is developed by **4AI Info Tech**, a technology company based in Ankara, Turkey, dedicated to creating powerful yet privacy-focused mobile applications.

## Our Story

After the success of SendFaxPro, our fax solution used by thousands of businesses worldwide, we recognized a complementary need in the document workflow space. Users needed a better way to create high-quality digital documents before sending them.

Thus, ScanDocPro was born.

## Our Mission

We believe that:

- **Professional tools should be accessible** to everyone, not just enterprises
- **Privacy is non-negotiable** in the modern digital landscape
- **AI should enhance human capability**, not replace it
- **Technology should work offline** when possible

## The Team

Our diverse team brings together expertise in:

- **Computer Vision** and image processing
- **Machine Learning** and AI
- **Mobile Development** for iOS and Android
- **Cybersecurity** and privacy engineering

## Our Products

### ScanDocPro
AI-powered document scanning with OCR and enhancement.

### SendFaxPro

Together, they form the **4AI Utility Bundle**—a complete solution for document creation and delivery.
